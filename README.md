  What is SVG by definition? This is a vector markup. In fact, we do not work with the construction of pixel display. 
  We build vectors with our own modules and angles. After that we get different planes. 
  To build a plane, we need 3 points, or 2 vectors. The library three.js does all the work within us for us. 
  We only set the initial parameters. In this task, I generated an SVG image that can be rotated along all axes
  After that, I can import any such object in the Java Script environment. 
  Knowing the size and initial parameters of the object, I can place and rotate such an object as I please.
  I can also work with 3D objects depending on their initial parameters, place them at some control points in the space of three axes.
